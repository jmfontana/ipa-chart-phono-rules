<h3>A model of cultural co-evolution of language and perspective-taking</h3>

Language relies on theory of mind, as language users have to entertain and recognise communicative intentions. Theory of mind abilities in turn profit from language, as language provides a means for expressing mental states explicitly, and for transmitting one’s understanding of minds to others (e.g. younger members of the population). Given this interdependence, it has been hypothesised that language and theory of mind have co-evolved. We present an agent-based model to formalise this hypothesis, which combines referential signalling with perspective-taking. In this model, agents’ communicative behaviour is probabilistically determined by an interplay between their language and their perspective on the world. In order to learn the language, learners thus have to simultaneously infer both the language and the perspective of their input speaker (using Bayesian inference). Simulation results show that learners can solve this task by bootstrapping one from the other, but only if the speaker uses a language that is at least somewhat informative.
<br>
<br>
The question then becomes under what circumstances a population of these agents can evolve such an informative language from scratch. We explore two different selection pressures: a pressure for successful communication and a pressure for accurate perspective-inference. We also compare two different types of agents: literal communicators and pragmatic communicators (where the latter optimise their communication behaviour using the rational speech act model). Iterated learning results show that literal agents can evolve meaningful linguistic conventions both under a pressure for communication and under a pressure on perspective-inference, but that the languages evolving under the communication pressure are more informative. Pragmatic agents on the other hand evolve languages of similar informativeness under both selection pressures, leading to comparable (high) levels of success at both communication and perspective-inference, because these agents can compensate for a suboptimal language using their pragmatic ability. Time permitting, I will also present some results on the evolvability of this pragmatic ability.

<h3>Reverberant Bayes: Lessons and limitations of Bayesian iterated learning</h3>

Since its publication in 2007, the Bayesian analysis of iterated learning of Griffiths and Kalish has rippled through the field. Serving as the basis for many follow-up studies, the Bayesian model has become the default formalization of iterated learning. This led Kirby (2017) to conclude that it holds promise for “precisely [understanding] what cultural evolution contributes to the explanation of language universals over and above what is built into our model of learning.” This talk revisits that conclusion. We discuss the relation between cognitive biases, the cultural process and universals, and find that the Bayesian model and the corresponding convergence results are less informative than often thought. This becomes clear when considering horizontal transfer and the assumed Bayesian rationality. We conclude with a call for ‘entity-based’ (e.g. words) models complementing agent-based models, and accordingly, good-old-fashioned linguistic data analysis.

<h3>Not unreasonable: Carving vague dimensions with contraries and contradictions</h3>

<font size=3>Language provides multiple ways of conveying the opposite: A person who is said to be "not happy" can be unhappy, sad, or perhaps neither, just not happy. Rather than being redundant, we hypothesize that uncertainty about the meaning of negation markers allows listeners to derive fine-grained distinctions among these various alternatives. We formalize this hypothesis in a probabilistic model of gradable adjectives (e.g., “happy"), and use this to address an outstanding puzzle: how to interpret double negations (e.g., "not unhappy"). Our model makes surprising additional predictions about a putative difference between morphological antonyms (unhappy) and negated positives (not happy): Listeners should judge “unhappy" as more sad than "not happy" only when confronted with alternatives in context; when interpreted in isolation, we predict no difference in understanding. Two behavioral experiments confirm consistent orderings of interpretations that interact with the presentational context in the way predicted. These findings support the hypothesis that listeners represent uncertainty even about the most logical elements of language.</font>
