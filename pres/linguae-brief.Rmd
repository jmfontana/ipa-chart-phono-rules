Modest re-analysis of Kanwal et al. (2017) to
  * explicitly model subjects' behavior
  
  * gain insight into how population-level, dyadic-level and individual-level relate to each other; and how to possibly begin to link them

# Experimental setup
Kanwal et al. (2017) condition 4

---

## Training (miniature lexicon acquisition)
```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, }
knitr::include_graphics('./artificial-language-cropped.jpg')
```


---
# Testing (condition 4) 

* Pair subjects and let them interact for 62 trials<br><br>32 sender trials, 32 receiver trials (alternating)<br><br>

* Same object frequencies as in training<br><br>

* Message transmission time is proportional to message length<br> $\rightarrow$ Sending ambiguous *zop* takes $\frac{3}{7}$ of the time of alternatives <br><br>

* The fastest & most accurate pairs win a prize<br> $\rightarrow$ Pressure to use short form if you believe your interlocutor will get it

---

# Kanwal et al's analysis

* Logistic regression with short name as binary response<br><br>

* Object frequency (frequent/infrequent), trial number, and their interaction as fixed effects<br><br>

* By-participant intercepts and slopes as random effects for object frequency and trial number<br><br><br><br>

**Finding:** Positive effect of trial number on short form use only for frequent object<br><br>

---

# Some open questions

1. How did individual speakers behave?<br><br>
  * Change over time
  * On what strategies did they converge<br><br>
2. How did their behavior compare to that of their partners?<br><br>
3. How do population-level predictions compare to (1) and (2)?<br><br>
4. How can we relate trends from individuals and dyads to a community of speakers?

---

# Some model desiderata

* Accommodate for multiple association patterns (cf. Parikh 2000)

* Accommodate for signaling behavior that can change as a function of interlocutor's behavior

## Intuitions

* RSA-style choice functions (*soft-max*; *Luce's rule*; *rationality parameter*)
<br><br>"If I believe you expect one object over the other (by a large enough margin) I will use the ambiguous but preferred form to convey that object. Otherwise, I'll play it safe."<br><br>

--

* Players can change beliefs over time, based on past success/failure using an ambiguous form<br><br>"You interpreted my use of an ambiguous form in a certain way before. Consequently, I believe you expected this object (and therefore I will be more likely to signal this object with this expression later)"

\begin{align}

and
\begin{align}
P_{t+1}(pr \mid w(r);m) \propto (\sum_{r' \in w(r)}\rho(r' \mid m;pr)P_t(pr)),
\end{align}
with $w(r) = \{r\}$ if the interaction was successful and $R \setminus \{r\}$ otherwise.

**Finding** The best model, $HM_{\lambda,\alpha,\beta}$, is ranked first, also across other data subsets and when splitting dyads up

## Individual-level estimates

---
## Other relationships

* Individuals' expected rationality, $E[\lambda_i]$, correlates with number of successes ( $r \approx 0.84$ )<br><br>

--

* Uncertainty about partner's expectations decrease over time<br> ( $r \approx -0.55$ between trial number and width of $P_i's \;\; 0.89\%$ HPDI)<br><br>

--

* Individual's beliefs diverge from population but grow closer to their partner's over time<br> ( $r \approx 0.56$ and $r \approx -0.23$, measured as Kullback-Leibler divergence)<br><br>

--

* Subject's own beliefs stabilize over time<br>( $r \approx -0.22$ between trial number and KL divergence)<br><br>

--

* Neither divergence from population belief nor width of the $P_i$'s HPDI are related to individuals' rates of success ( $r \approx 0.004$ and $r \approx 0.02$)

## Accuracy
.large[
* $HM_{\lambda,\alpha,\beta}$ has RMSE of $0.32$

* Always predicting short for frequent has RMSE of $0.63$ (cf. Parikh 2000)

* Always predicting short for infrequent has RMSE of $0.78$

* Always avoiding it has RMSE of $0.67$

RMSE of best model reduces to $0.28$ or $0.24$ when excluding $4$ or $8$ worst-faring subjects

# Taking stock


---

## Narrower remarks

.large[
* Population-level trend is held up: short(er) patterns with more frequent
  * Rooted in expectations carried over from training
  
* Over time, individuals' established conventions of all flavors
  * frequent $\rightarrow$ shorter
  * infrequent $\rightarrow$ shorter
  * (in)frequent $\rightarrow$ longer
  
* This is one possible explanation of Zipf's Law of Abbreviation, but
  * Link between dyads and population missing
  * In particular: neutral alternatives
]

---

## Broader remarks
1. Where possible and called for
  * model variation at multiple levels
  
  * make relationship between levels explicit 

--

2. Population-level trends can often hide individual-level variation, but the former ultimately draw from the latter.

--

3. Many individual-level patterns go against theoretical predictions (Zipf's Law of Abbreviation, Horn's division of pragmatic labor, Parikh's disambiguation model, ...). The reasons for this are likely manifold.

--

4. How dyadic-conventions find their way into the population is still a major and fascinating open question (cf. Hawkins et al. *forthcoming*)

--

5. Whether the association of the ambiguous form with the (in)frequent meaning is semantic or pragmatic in nature is another open question
